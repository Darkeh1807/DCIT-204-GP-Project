## Project Summary
A piece of software designed to address problems with taking the long or incorrect route when traveling. It assists by identifying every route that could be taken from a user-defined source to a particular destination and then choosing the one that is most advantageous in terms of cost, time, and distance.

## Objectives
We were able to determine the distances and travel times between a few (chosen for testing purposes and to achieve the deadline) points on the UG campus.
With these variables, we have developed graph data structures. These graphs provide the best route between any two points as well as all other possible routes. 

## Key Features
A modified Depth-First Search on the graph that produced all the paths was utilized to look for all routes between two points. In order to get the shortest distance between the spots, Vogel's Approximation was then applied. The shortest time for the best distance was then calculated using the North-West Corner Method.

## The algorithms used and how you integrated they we implemented
In searching for all routes between two points, a modified Depth-First Search was used on the graph which produced all the paths. Then, Vogelâ€™s Approximation was used to compute the shortest distance between the points. North-West Corner Method was then used to compute the shortest time for the optimum distance.
